 * Given a word, you need to judge whether the usage of capitals in it is right or not.
 * We define the usage of capitals in a word to be right when one of the following cases holds:
 * All letters in this word are capitals, like "USA".
 * All letters in this word are not capitals, like "leetcode".
 * Only the first letter in this word is capital if it has more than one letter, like "Google".
 * Otherwise, we define that this word doesn't use capitals in a right way.
